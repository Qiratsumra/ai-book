# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics: Bridging the Digital and Physical Worlds

Welcome to the official textbook for the **AI-Native developer**. This book is your comprehensive guide to the convergence of artificial intelligence and physical systems, focusing on the design, simulation, and deployment of **humanoid robots**. We aim to equip you with the knowledge to build intelligent agents that interact seamlessly with the real world.

## 🤖 What is Physical AI?

**Physical AI** refers to the branch of Artificial Intelligence concerned with agents (like robots) that perceive, reason, and act within the physical world. Unlike purely digital AI, Physical AI deals with real-world constraints such as **physics, latency, noise, and safety**. It is the essential technology for realizing true **autonomy** in robotics.

## 🏗️ Core Technologies Covered

This textbook provides a deep dive into the industry-standard tools and frameworks for modern robotics development:

* **ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2):** The industry-standard meta-operating system for building complex robot applications.
* **Gazebo / NVIDIA Omniverse:** Advanced simulation environments for testing and validating robotic algorithms in a virtual, physics-accurate space before deployment. 
* **Unity:** A powerful platform for visualization, control, and creating high-fidelity interactive robotic twins.
* **NVIDIA Isaac:** A hardware and software platform that accelerates the development and deployment of AI-powered robots.

### 🌐 Bridging the Digital and Physical

You will learn how to transition seamlessly from **model training in the cloud** (the digital world) to **real-time execution on the robot** (the physical world) using concepts like **Digital Twins** and **Reinforcement Learning from Simulation (RL-from-Sim)**.

## 🚀 Get Started

To begin your journey into Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics, please proceed to the [Preface](./preface/index.md), which will outline the book's structure and prerequisites.
